# Why: The EcoBites Story

## Our Mission: Sustainable Food Delivery for a Greener Future

EcoBites was born from a simple yet powerful idea: food delivery should not only be convenient and delicious, but also environmentally responsible. In a world where food waste and carbon emissions from delivery services are growing concerns, we believe technology can drive positive change.

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional food delivery platforms focus primarily on speed and convenience, often at the expense of our planet. Single-use packaging, inefficient routing, and lack of incentives for sustainable choices have contributed to:
- Millions of tons of plastic waste annually
- Increased carbon emissions from delivery vehicles
- Food waste from undelivered or unwanted orders
- Lack of transparency in the environmental impact of food choices
