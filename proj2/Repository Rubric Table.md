| Notes | Evidence | Score |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... \-- |  |  |
| but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot) | Manually verified (GH History) | 3 |
| Number of commits | Manually verified (GH History) | 3 |
| Number of commits: by different people | Manually verified (GH History) | 3 |
| Issues reports: there are **many** | Manually verified (GH History)  | 3 |
| Issues are being closed | Manually verified (GH History) | 3 |
| Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | `proj2/docs/` directory | 3 |
| Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | `proj2/docs/api.md`, `proj2/docs/what.md` | 3 |

| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | `proj2/docs/why.md` | 3 |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. | Video link was found in `README.md` | 3 |
| Use of version control tools | git | 3 |

| Issues are discussed before they are closed | Manually verified (GH History) | 3 |
| Chat channel: exists | GitHub Issues & Discord | 3 |
| Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. | Manually verified (GH History) | 2 |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files | Lint & Format test ensure the same tools and files | 3 |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | `proj2/EcoBites/client/package.json`, `proj2/EcoBites/server/pyproject.toml`, `proj2/.prettierrc` | 3 |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer) | External verification needed | 3 |
| Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base | Manually verified (GH History) | 3 |
| Short release cycles | Manually verified (frequent commits) | 3 |
| The file .gitignore lists what files should not be saved to the repo. See [examples](https://github.com/github/gitignore) | `proj2/.gitignore`, `proj2/EcoBites/client/.gitignore`, `proj2/EcoBits/server/.gitignore` | 3 |
