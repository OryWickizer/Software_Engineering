# EcoBites

## Our Mission

At EcoBites, we are redefining food delivery with sustainability at its core, empowering customers to make every meal an eco-conscious choice. Through our food delivery website, we provide flexible eco-friendly options, from reusable or compostable packaging to rewards for low-carbon delivery methods, while encouraging shared orders to reduce trips. Our goal is to create a food delivery experience that benefits people, communities, and the planet—one conscious meal at a time.

### How It Works

### Impact

- **Customers:** Customers are at the heart of our
mission. They seek convenient,
delicious meals while making
environmentally conscious
choices. Our app provides them
with tools to track their personal
impact, select sustainable options,
and participate in eco-friendly
challenges. By engaging customers
through rewards, gamification, and
transparency, we empower them
to make food choices that are
better for the planet
- **Restaurants:** Restaurants are our partners in
creating a sustainable food
ecosystem. We collaborate with
them to offer locally-sourced,
seasonal, and plant-forward menu
options, while encouraging ecofriendly packaging and practices. By
showcasing restaurants’
sustainability efforts, we help them
atrract conscious customers and
build a reputation as
environmentally responsible
businesses.
- **Delivery Platforms/Admins:** Delivery drivers are essential for
connecting meals from
restaurants to customers. We
support drivers by promoting
low-emission delivery methods,
such as bicycles, electric vehicles,
or route-optimized trips. Drivers
are incentivized to adopt
sustainable practices through
rewards and recognition,
contributing directly to reducing
the carbon footprint of each
delivery.

## Development Roadmap

### **October – Release 1: Prototype**

- Implement authentication flow for different users (Customers, Restaurants, and Drivers). Restaurants can add menu items, customers can order, and drivers can update deliveries. Users are able to login to accounts with appropriate functionality.
- Build a frontend UI to allow users to browse ecofriendly restaurants, place orders, and track deliveries.
- Eco Packaging Selection - Restaurants can choose if their packaging is reusable, minimal, or compostable, and customers can use that information to inform their eco-friendly selections.
- Seasonal Menu Highlight - When adding items to their menu, restaurants can highlight an item as seasonal and customers can earn points for ordering seasonal items
- Community Sharing / Group Orders - Customers can opt-in to having their order combined with a neighbor or co-workers order to reduce packaging and waste. This will earn them rewards, in order to encourage eco-freiendly choices.
- Rewards System Partially Implemented - When customers select seasonal items or group their orders to reduce packaging waste, driver's earn points for selecting those orders

### **November – Release 2: Enhanced System**

- Eco Challenge & Gamification - Participate in challenges like reducing single-use plastics or trying plant-based meals to earn rewards and points on the leaderboard
- Canceled Orders & Leftovers - If someone cancels an order or has leftovers, others can bid to claim it, reducing food waste.
Eco Impact Receipts - View a personalized impact dashboard showing water saved, CO₂ prevented, and weekly comparisons.
- ML / LLM Eco-Friendly Restaurant & Food Recommendations - Get AI-powered recommendations for meals and restaurants with the lowest environmental impact.
- Drivers get Incentives for Using eco Friendly Vehicles - Drivers using electric vehicles, bikes, or low-emission methods earn incentives for greener deliveries.
- Implement Ratying System and Carbon Tracker
